            <p><strong>My name is Anelle</strong>. I am from Brazil but moved to Ottawa with my family six months ago. With a background in Business Administration, I've spent the last 14 years working as an administrative assistant. However, the opportunity to move out of the country sparked a desire for a career change, pushing me towards something I truly enjoy and identify with. Passionate about both art and technology, I've decided to dive into the world of <em>Graphic Design</em>. This transition has been challenging, especially due to the new language, but it's a journey I'm eager to embrace.</p>

            <p>Though my studies in graphic design are recent, my love for the field has deep roots. Throughout the years, I've consistently engaged with art and design, whether through drawing, image editing, creating graphics for invitations and events, or capturing moments behind the lens. Completed my first semester, I can confidently say that my initial feelings of connection and passion for graphic design were well-founded. Although it is hard work, it is all very enjoyable for me, making the journey enjoyable.</p>
